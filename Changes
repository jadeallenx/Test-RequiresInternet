            Some Test::More instances get very cranky 
	    when there are no "real" tests at all in
	    a test file. Add one. Thanks to David
	    Farrell for the patch.                       (GH#1)

            Use 'require_ok' instead of 'use_ok' so we 
            don't run import() in environments where no
            network is available.                        (RT #96892)
